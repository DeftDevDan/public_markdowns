The Jupyter Notebook's amazing versatility arises because it can let you process your inputs AND see your outputs or visualizations in the same location. 

Jupyter Notebooks organizes code into CELLS.
A group of cells is called a KERNEL.

The active cell with be outlined with a green line. 

Each cell contains code that can be run independently with the 'Run' button.
Alternatively, you can click on 'Kernel' and 'Restart & Run All'. This will run all the cells in order.

It is VERY IMPORTANT to remember that cells have to be run IN ORDER.
If a cell is not run, the information in it will NOT be available to the remainder of the code.

You can create a new cell by clicking the '+' icon button.
You can delete a cell by clicking on the scissors icon button.
Alternatively, click 'Insert' and choose 'Insert Cell Above' or 'Insert Cell Below'.
You can move a cell up or down in the order by clicking the respective arrow icon botton.

Your cells can contain 'code' or 'text'. This is determined by the dialogue box just above the top cell.
Code - the cell will act on the written code. 
If you wan to type text in a 'Code' cell, it must be preceeded with a hash-tag '#'.
If you only want it to include text, click in the dialogue box and  choose 'Markdown'.

You will notice that cells have an 'In[]' label to the left. This stands for input.
When a cell is 'run', it will generate output that shows up just below the cell and will be marked 'Out[]'.
To clear the output of a cell, you can click 'Cell', 'Current Output', 'Clear'.
To clear the output of the entire sheet, click 'Cell', 'All Outputs', 'Clear'.
